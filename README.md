*Warning!* Do not put in your real password. The form method is "get" and not "post" for the sake of demonstration. Your inputs will appear in the url as plain text, and can be viewable in your browser history.

## About
This sign-up form was created with HTML and SCSS as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## Page Features
* Sign up for a (fake) online service by inputting your personal information.
* Receieve real-time feedback whether your inputs are valid or not.
* Only submit your form if all required inputs are valid

## Code Features
*The following features were the main concepts I learned and implemented in this project.*

* Structure large forms with multiple inputs

### (S)CSS:
